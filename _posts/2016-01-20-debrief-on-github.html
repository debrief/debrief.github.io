<h2>Debrief is Hosted on Github</h2>
<p>Debrief is hosted on a platform/repository called <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub.</a> If you’re familiar with GitHub, that’s great; but if you’re not, then we have created some blog posts to help you get up to speed fast.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but whenever I start with something new I'm eager to get hands-on and start learning.</p>
<p>However, this is not always the best way to proceed, as it can waste your time and the time of whoever created it. For example, if you miss something because you went out of sequence, or jumped ahead, then you've got to either go back and sort it yourself, or get help. Neither of which is ideal.</p>
<p>This is why many software developers create a series of tutorials to walk you through the program in the order that you're meant to. This way you can take it at your own pace, you're guaranteed not to miss anything, and you'll be using the program as it's meant to be used.</p>
<p>This is what we've done with Debrief.</p>
<p>We've created a series of posts that will ensure you're not wasting time and will allow you to devote as much time as you need to using and learning our software.</p>
<p>Our posts and the recommended order are as follows:</p>
