<p>Analysts said they wanted to analyse a video feed synced with the track plot so that they have more context to the tracks they’re analysing.</p>
<p>Well we’ve been working on just that. Take a look at the video below and tell us what you think. What other features do you want to see?</p>

<p>Use scenario: Let's imagine that that during an exercise a drone is recording what it sees. You want to be able to watch it in sync with the tracks in Debrief. So as you change the time in Debrief’s Time Controller the video will jump to the same time. Similarly, jumping to a point in the video also moves Debrief to that time. Playing either one causes the other to also play.</p>
