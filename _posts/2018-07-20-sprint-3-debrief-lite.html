<p>Sprint 3 has largely been behind-the-scenes efforts to get ready for some upcoming significant features (especially Debrief Lite).</p>
<p>An automated build/test of Debrief Classic is now performed on every commit, and it's now included in every release (rebadged as Debrief Lite). This has allowed us to de-risk the eventual builds of Debrief Lite proper. Debrief Lite _may_ grow from Debrief Classic, but we've got to complete our Usability (UX) planning regarding "what would the perfect lightweight version of Debrief look like?" before we can make a decision.</p>
<p>We've also made great progress in the export to PPT capability, with (manual) support for two quite different master slides. Look out for this capability being integrated into Debrief at the end of Sprint 4.</p>
