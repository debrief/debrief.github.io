<p>Symbols are used to add value to analysis plots, through giving a visual indication of the vehicle type.</p>
<p>In the past, the symbols have been hard-coded in Debrief, but now Debrief supports the provision of vectored symbols in the industry standard SVG format.</p>
<p>The first set of symbols is shown below.</p>
<p>Please feel free to request any other commonly required symbols, together with a pointer to an example of what it should look like, and we'll get our designer onto it.</p>

<p><img class="spotlight" src="#" alt="No automatic alt text available." aria-busy="true" /></p>
