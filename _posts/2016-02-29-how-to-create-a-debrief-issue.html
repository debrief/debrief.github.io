<h2>Creating a Debrief Issue</h2>
<p>If you find that Debrief isn’t behaving as it should then it’s possible that you’ve encountered a <b>bug</b> in the software. If you do, then you’ll need to let the Debrief team know about it so they can fix it.</p>
<p>We report bugs in the software by raising what is called <b>an issue</b>. You can create an issue in the Debrief repository in Github. Like other tasks in Github, it’s easy to do.</p>
<p>When you report an issue the support team will receive notification that this has been filed and will address it as soon as possible. When trying to fix any bug in the system, the first thing that needs to be done is to try and recreate the issue - they can’t fix it if they can’t replicate the issue.</p>
<p>As such, it’s critical that when you report a bug, you must provide as much information about what you were doing before and when the bug appeared.</p>
<p>This needs to include enough <b>relevant </b>information for support to work from:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>The version of Debrief that you are using </b>- you can get this by clicking on <b>Help </b>then on <b> About</b> in Debrief itself:</li>
</ol>
<p class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/07_debrief_version.png" alt="Finding your version of Debrief"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><b>The java version on your machine</b> - you can also get this from the same <b>About</b> dialog by:
<ol type="a">
<li>Clicking on the <b>Installation Details</b> button.</li>
<li>Click on the <b>Configuration</b> tab then scroll down to java… (they’re in alphabetical order).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/java_version.png" alt="Finding your java version number"/></p>
<ol>
<ol>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>Highlight and copy the java version (<b>Ctrl+C</b>).</li>
<li>Paste it into your email (<b>Ctrl+V</b>).</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><b>The steps you took which caused the bug to appear</b> - this is important as the team may need to follow your exact steps to reproduce the error.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There’s no need to include steps which aren’t relevant here as it may cause confusion and/or slow down the fault-finding and fixing process. Please try to be as factual as possible; but again, if you think the information if relevant, please include it.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><b>The expected result </b>- though this is not always obvious, if you know what the result should be, this can help the developers analyse the issue, i.e. if you’re creating a new project then you know at the end of the wizard, you should have a new project in your outline view. If you don’t then provide the actual result.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you see an error message, include that. If you see something in a log file, or a log file is created, include that also.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><b>Actual result</b> - this is so the team can compare what did happen against what should have happened. This way, they can go through the code line-by-line and see where the error occurred and why.</li>
<li><b>Other information or material</b> - nowadays, there are a number of free programs available which enable you to capture screenshots and screen videos; if you can provide as much information, or even replicate the issue while creating a video or taking snapshots of error messages and the like, then this can be of enormous help to the support team.</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Screen and Video Capture Tools</b></h3>
<p>Programs available to capture your screen are:</p>
<h4><b><i>PC:</i></b></h4>
<ul>
<li>Screen video software - <b>Jing </b>(by Techsmth). <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/jing.html" target="_blank">Click here to go to Techsmith’s website</a>.</li>
<li>Image capturing software - I do know you can print screen and open in Paint, but an easier method is to use Windows’ built-in screen capture software called <b>Snipping Tool</b>. To access this:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Click on Start then, in the <b>Search Programs and Files </b>search box, start typing the word <i>s-n-i-p</i>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/snipping_tool.png" alt="Window's Snipping Tool - great for screenshots"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Click on the program to open it, and you can use it to take as many screen capture images as you want.</li>
</ol>
<h4><b><i>Mac:</i></b></h4>
<ul>
<li>Screen video software - the Mac has <b>QuickTime Player </b>built-in, which allows you to do a <b>New Screen Recording</b>: <img class="img-fluid" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mac_new_screen_recording.png" alt="New Screen Recording _ Mac"/></li>
<li>Image capturing software - to capture a full screenshot on the Mac, press <b>Cmd</b>+<b>Shift</b>+<b>3</b> at the same time (that’s what I used to capture the image above).</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>GitHub’s File Size Limit</b></h3>
<p>Github has a file size attachment limit of 100 MB, and will warn you for files exceeding 50 MB. However, for large files, we would recommend using a free utility called Dropbox to save and share your files.</p>
<p>Dropbox stores the files you create in a folder on your hard drive and then synchronises them to the cloud. When the files has been synchronised, you can share a link and then include that link as part of the issue.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on your file in Dropbox and then select <strong>Share Dropbox Link</strong>. If this is not available yet, wait a few minutes for Dropbox to upload the file and set the link.</li>
</ol>
<p class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/share_dropboxlink.png" alt="Share a Dropbox Link"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Paste the link into your email:</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="img-fluid" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/dropbox_link.png" alt="Paste the Dropbox link into your email"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/install" target="_blank">Click here to get Dropbox</a></p>
<p>We would recommend using Dropbox for uploading videos or very large images.</p>
<p>So, using any of the methods above, you can hopefully provide all the required information to help us resolve the issue. So, after all that, let’s look at creating a new issue.</p>
<h2><b>Creating a New Issue</b></h2>
<p>To create a new issue in Github/Debrief you do need a GitHub account. This is the preferred method of reporting issues/bugs to us, so if you don’t have an account it’s a good idea to create one (it’s free, it’s quick, and it is easy to do). However, if you’d prefer not to register, you can still help us by sending us an email with the above details.<br />
