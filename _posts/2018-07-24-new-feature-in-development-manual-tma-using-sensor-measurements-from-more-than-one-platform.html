<p> Part of the package of new features to support multi-statics is to allow manual TMA to be conducted using sensor measurements from more than one platform.</p>
<p>This video shows how sensor data from two floating sensor buoys can be used to triangulate a straight leg of positional data.</p>
<p>The changes to support this have affected the deep internals of Debrief's TMA processing, so we've got a few more days of integration testing to do before it's ready for prime-time, but we're on track for it to be available next week.</p>
