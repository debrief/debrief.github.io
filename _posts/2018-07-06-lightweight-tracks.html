<p>In today's release we're including a technical demonstrator for Lightweight Tracks.</p>
<p>Some analysis tasks require the analysis of traffic passing through the exercise area. This could come from radar, AIS or IFF, and can be hundreds (or even thousands) of tracks.</p>
<p>But, in traditional Debrief practice, all tracks sit at the top level of the Outline View, and they can be difficult to manage.</p>
<p>Plus, plotting such a large number of tracks can be a performance hit.</p>
<p>So, we've introduced lightweight tracks that, because they have less formatting, can be plotted much more quickly.</p>
<p>It's also possible to store lightweight tracks in folders, to both help manage them and to de-clutter the top level of the Outline View.</p>
<p>Have a look in the attached video:</p>
