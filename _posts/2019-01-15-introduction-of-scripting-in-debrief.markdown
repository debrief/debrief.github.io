<p>After a couple of months of development, we're preparing the release of the new Debrief scripting ability</p>
<p>This new capability is intended to enable Debrief Power Users to take on more advanced data manipulation tasks,
including:
* Apply bulk changes to Debrief objects
* Import unexpected data-types from file
* Conduct ad-hoc calculations on Debrief data
