<p>With the conclusion of Sprint 4, the first major work package ("Epic" in Scrum language) is coming to completion, Export to PPT. In a multi-threaded package of work different members of the team have:</p>
<ul>
<li>designed PowerPoint master slides</li>
<li>developed Python code to iteratively work through the various processes involved in transforming Debrief screen pixels into MS PowerPoint entities</li>
<li>Design a tidy, sensible UX that leads the user through the export process</li>
<li>Transform the working Python into Java, then wrap that code in unit and integration tests</li>
<li>Develop the new UI elements, and integrate the new Java export code</li>
</ul>
<p>The implementation has 1/2 dozen minor features to be added/refined, which will slip the final release into next week - but a screencast of the working implementation is shown below:</p>
