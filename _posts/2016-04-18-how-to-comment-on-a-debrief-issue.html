<h2>Commenting on a Debrief Issue</h2>
<p>Commenting on any open or closed Debrief issue, whether your own or anyone else's, is easy to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <b>Subject </b>line of the issue you wish to comment on to view the issue:</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3270" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/01_open_issue1.png" alt="Opening an Issue" width="701" height="248" /></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The issue will then display:</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3269" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/02_comment_box.png" alt="GitHub Comment Box" width="698" height="668" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As the above image shows, there is a comment box below the original issue raised, and any additions, changes, or comments added since then in chronological order. To add a comment:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Click in the <b>Write </b>field and enter your comment.</li>
<li>Once your comment has been added, click on the <b>Preview</b> tab to view how it will look once submitted. This isn’t necessarily that important if you’re not using <b>markdown </b>text*, but it’s always a good idea to give everything you write a once-over before posting.</li>
<li>You can add files to your comment by either dragging and dropping them into the form, of by clicking on the <b>selecting them</b> text link. This will open up a <b>File Upload</b> dialog box where you can locate and add your files.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As mentioned in our earlier post, <a href="http://debrief.info/how-to-create-a-debrief-issue/"><i>Creating a Debrief Issue</i></a>, bear in mind that Github does have a limit on attachment file sizes, so please consider using Dropbox (or similar) to provide access to excessively large files.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Once your comment is ready to post, click on the <b>Comment</b> button. Your post will be added to the issue.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: right;">* <b>Note</b>: if you’re familiar with using <b>Markdown</b> text, you can use this styling in all your Debrief/Github comments. <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/" target="_blank">Click here for more details on using the markdown format</a>.</p>
