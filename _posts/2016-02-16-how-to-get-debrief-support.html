<h2>Obtaining Debrief Support</h2>
<p>Debrief is a capable, fast, intuitive and immensely powerful tool for maritime analysis. Indeed, as well as being used by many navies around the world, it’s also used by governmental and non-governmental agencies in many countries. Being open-source software, it is free to use; it works on multiple platforms; is well-documented with written tutorials, video training, and a comprehensive user guide; and, has been under continuous maintenance for 20-years. It truly is a great tool.</p>
<p>As it is open source software, we are committed to providing a level of free support for all users of Debrief (and have no plans to do otherwise). However, please understand that though this support is  given freely, we have to give priority to our support contracts.</p>
<h3><b>Support Levels </b></h3>
<p>We offer 3 levels of support for organisations for whom rapid response and issue resolution is key. These are <b>Support Basic</b>, <b>Support Plus</b>, and <b>Custom support</b>. We’ll look at each level of support in turn.</p>
<h4><b>Free</b></h4>
<p>This level of support is open to all users. As mentioned, Debrief if hosted on GitHub and support issues can be submitted in one of two ways by both registered and unregistered users.</p>
<ul>
<li>Registered users can open an <b>Issue </b>on our GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/debrief" target="_blank">Debrief on GitHub</a>). Once submitted, the user will then be notified of any updates to their issue in GitHub. If you read the previous post (<a href="http://debrief.info/access-debrief-github-repository/">How to Access the Debrief GitHub Repository</a>) you’ll know what benefits this offers to serious businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Registered users can do so by clicking on the <b>New Issue</b> button in the repository and filling in details of the message (<a href="https://github.com/debrief/debrief/issues" target="_blank">click here for details</a>):</p>

<h2><b>Custom Support</b></h2>
<p>As open source software, you can customise Debrief as you wish and really make it work for you. However, if you’d prefer not to do that in-house, or you would like the reassurance of having our experts support you, help develop new capabilities, or even leverage your analyst’s contextual knowledge then we can assist via either a <i>fixed price</i> or a <i>bespoke </i>package.</p>
<h3><b><i>Fixed Price</i></b></h3>
<p>With our fixed price package, we can develop new components and capabilities such as customised symbol libraries, and analysis tool capabilities to evolve alongside your analysis requirements, which allows your analysts to focus on delivering effective results.</p>
<p>For example, we can create symbols to represent your own particular platforms and vehicles; can create new file import and export interfaces; and, can widen support for complex file types in Debrief.</p>

<h3><b><i>Bespoke</i></b></h3>

<p>Examples of where we can assist you are in development projects aimed at making better use of your analyst’s effort, and improving results through innovative analysis of data types, new concepts, and access to newer and better performance metrics.</p>
