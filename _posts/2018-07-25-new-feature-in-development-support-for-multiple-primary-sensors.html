<p>Analysts have always been able to use Target Motion Analysis (TMA) algorithms to predict missing track data using passive sensor data.</p>
<p>Traditionally, this has only allowed use of a single sensor. Now analysts would like to triangulate a track using multiple sensors.</p>
<p>This trial release will let you do just that, to perform manual TMA.</p>
<p>Use scenario: Say a platform has hull-mounted and towed sensors. This video shows how analysts can use both data points in Debrief’s existing manual TMA facilities, with the embryonic Semi-Automatic TMA Construction to create a TMA solution that’s very close to the truth.</p>
