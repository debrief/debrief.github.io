<p> The main way for narrative data to get into Debrief is by the translation of system recording into .REP format.</p>
<p>But, on occasion a Debrief analyst wishes to enter one or more narrative entries directly into Debrief.</p>
<p>Historically this has always been possible right-clicking on the Narratives folder in the Outline View, or by right-clicking into empty space if there isn't (yet) a Narratives folder.</p>
<p>From today it's also possible to add a new narrative entry directly from the Narrative Viewer. See the following screencast for more detail.</p>
