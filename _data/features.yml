  - title: GRID EDITOR
    text: 'Yes, the onboard sensors may be less than perfect. Don’t worry, Debrief’s Grid Editor allows you to use your understanding of the data to perform a range of grooming operations: from removing outliers, inserting missing data, right through to smoothing values to remove quantisation artifacts'

  - title: TRACK TOTE
    text: 'Don’t worry about pulling out your protractor and slide rule to calculate the relative geometry between subject platforms.  Once a participant is denoted as primary, you can add any number of other platforms as secondaries. Immediately, Debrief displays their range, bearing, and platform states, synced to the currently displayed time'

  - title: TIME CONTROLLER
    text: The Time Controller is the home of all time-related activity.  You’ll use the main slider to control the point in time at which data is displayed. But this composite control goes a lot further to help you select and refine your snapshot. Use it to show or hide data, to show whole tracks or just recent points, to orient the plot, and to highlight the current location by marker, platform symbol or sensor coverage rings.'

    text: 'You always need to see accurate tracks.  But on occasion, it’s the background context that is fundamental to understanding the on-board decision making process.  Or, you just need to give some chart context to help your reader understand exactly where the trial took place.  Support for Admiralty Charts means it’s possible to view a whole chart catalog, then load only the charts of interest'
