        <p>This section records the high-level concepts related to the Semi-Automatic Track Construction (SATC) implementation in <span class="application">Debrief</span>. The content presented here represents system documentation, not necessarily targeted at the routine SATC user, user guidance is contained in <a class="xref" href="satc.html" title="12.3.&nbsp;Semi-Automated TMA generation">Section&nbsp;12.3, &#8220;Semi-Automated TMA generation&#8221;</a>.</p>



        <div class="section" id="d5e5870"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">19.1.1.&nbsp;Strategy</h3></div></div></div>
          

          <p>Some BOT strategies focus very strongly on the bearing data, with other aspects (priors, constraints, etc) used to refine the end product.</p>

          <p>Since we're doing this process with hindsight, we have more data available. So we're taking a more free-form approach, where any type of information can contribute to the solution. This will make it easier to add other contributing information in the future. </p>

          <p>Each time the analyst/user submits some information to be used in the algorithm he's contributing to the answer - so the piece of information is termed a contribution. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="d5e5875"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">19.1.2.&nbsp;Process</h3></div></div></div>
          

          <p>In generating one or more vehicle solutions the system will first constrain the global problem space, then generate candidate solutions within that space, and lastly assess their performance. If none of the candidate solutions are acceptable the analyst may refine existing contributions, or supply more contributions to further inform the system. These phases are described in more detail later, once we've covered the necessary data concepts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="d5e5878"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">19.1.3.&nbsp;Data Concepts</h3></div></div></div>
          

          <div class="section" id="d5e5880"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">19.1.3.1.&nbsp;Scenario</h4></div></div></div>
            

            <p>A single instance of performing SATC on a set of data, plus contributions is called a Scenario. This includes all contributions and their states. It also includes the measurements that inform a Measurement Contributions. A scenario may be saved to file, in order that its analysis may continue at another time.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="section" id="d5e5883"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">19.1.3.2.&nbsp;Problem space</h4></div></div></div>
            

            <p>The problem space is a series of bounded vehicle state objects with a Vehicle Performance instance.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="section" id="d5e5886"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">19.1.3.3.&nbsp;Vehicle Track</h4></div></div></div>
            

            <p>A track is comprised of a series of Vehicle State objects. It represents an estimate of the path followed by a vehicle for a period of time. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="section" id="d5e5889"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">19.1.3.4.&nbsp;Leg</h4></div></div></div>
            

            <p>A leg represents a period of vehicle track. The leg may be a straight leg (representing the way vehicles normally move) or an alteration leg (representing how a vehicle makes the transition from one straight leg to another). The fact that the a set of Vehicle States (or Bounded Vehicle States) objects are in a straight or altering leg means we can infer further constraints/relaxations on them. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="section" id="d5e5892"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">19.1.3.5.&nbsp;Vehicle State</h4></div></div></div>
            

            <p>A vehicle state is represented as a time, location, course and speed. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="section" id="d5e5895"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">19.1.3.6.&nbsp;Bounded Vehicle State</h4></div></div></div>
            

            <p>A bounded vehicle state describes a range of possible vehicle states. It includes a course range (min-max, always clockwise), a speed range (min-max), and a polygon representing spatial constraints. </p>

            <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.gif"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">
              <p>We use a polygon for location instead of min/max values for lat/long values so that we gain access to more complex spatial operations. </p>
            </td></tr></table></div>

            <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.gif"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">
              <p>We may need to introduce non-continuous ranges for these states. We may need to constrain course, for example, to being in the range of either 040-060 or 130-150. But, as of Nov 2012 this requirement hasn't emerged yet.</p>

          <div class="section" id="d5e5902"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">19.1.3.7.&nbsp;Straight Leg</h4></div></div></div>
            

            <p>A straight leg is uniform, with constant course and speed. When constraining the problem space the leg will be formed from multiple bounded vehicle states, but when candidate solutions are being generated they will always have constant course and speed. During the Constrain the problem space phase we allow the straight leg to be comprised of varying bounded vehicle states to allow a manoeuvre detection algorithm to detect that there must actually be a course or speed change within the leg (since there isn't a single course or speed that is achievable along the whole leg), leading to the introduction of an alteration leg.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="section" id="d5e5905"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">19.1.3.8.&nbsp;Alteration Leg</h4></div></div></div>
            

            <p>An alteration leg allows for change in course and/or speed. The alteration leg may represent a speed change, a course change, or a period for which insufficient data is available to suggest straight-line travel (in which case there may be an unpredictable number of course/speed changes). Consequently an Alteration Leg doesn't just have values for vehicle state at either end, it is expressed as a series of vehicle states (or bounded vehicle states in the constrain the problem space phase).</p>
          </div>

          <div class="section" id="d5e5908"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">19.1.3.9.&nbsp;Contribution</h4></div></div></div>
            

            <p>A contribution is a piece of knowledge supplied by the analyst. Beyond the simple, abstract description provided below, specific contributions may contain great algorithmic complexity. </p>

            <div class="section" id="d5e5911"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title">19.1.3.9.1.&nbsp;Contribution attributes</h5></div></div></div>
              

              <p>The contribution will always have at least one of </p>

              <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist compact" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
                  <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Hard constraints</em></span> - these are values that are used to constrain the problem space. Candidate solutions will not be considered that fall outside these constraints</p>
                </li><li class="listitem">
                  <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Estimate</em></span> - these are values that are used to assess the performance of a candidate solution. The estimate may be a single value or a range. Candidate solutions will be assessed according to their proximity to the specified value/range.</p>
                </li></ul></div>

              <p>It may also have: </p>

              <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist compact" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
                  <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Time bounds</em></span> - the period for which the contribution is valid. Note: a contribution does not need time bounds. For example, a hard constraint that a vehicle has a maximum speed of 20 knots is time independent.</p>

                  <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Weighting</em></span> - used to affect the significance of this contribution when comparing candidate solutions (only used if estimate data is present)</p>
                </li></ul></div>
            </div>

            <div class="section" id="d5e5929"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title">19.1.3.9.2.&nbsp;Contribution abilities</h5></div></div></div>
              

              <p>A contribution is able to:</p>

              <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist compact" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
                  <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Constrain the problem space</em></span>: Take a set of bounded vehicle states, and return another set of bounded vehicle states. The returned set of bounded states will normally have been reduced in bounds by the contribution. But, the contribution may also have introduced new legs (with states). The introduction of new legs may be the product of a manoeuvre detection algorithm.</p>
                </li><li class="listitem">
                  <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Assess candidate solutions</em></span>: Take a series of vessel states and measure the error from any estimate values/ranges.</p>
                </li></ul></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="section" id="d5e5939"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">19.1.3.10.&nbsp;Reference contribution</h4></div></div></div>
            

            <p>This type of contribution represents some known fact about the vehicle. It may include max/min attainable speed, max/min acceleration and deceleration rates, and max/min turning circles. These contributions are normally time independent, and typically only have hard constraints. Reference contributions are typically only effective in constraining the problem space, they do not assist in the assessment of candidate solutions. An example of a reference contribution is the Vehicle Performance Reference Contribution.</p>

            <p>In implementation, it is expected that a &#8216;library' of reference data be made available to the analyst. The analyst may load a contribution from the library, but changes made to that contribution would only be made locally - the library would remain unchanged.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="section" id="d5e5943"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">19.1.3.11.&nbsp;Forecast Contribution</h4></div></div></div>
            

            <p>This type of contribution represents an analyst's forecast of vehicle behaviour. The forecasts are typically time bounded. They normally have estimates, and may also have hard constraints: &#8220;the vehicle is probably travelling between 4 and 6 knots. It is certainly not travelling outside 2 and 10 knots&#8221;. These contributions are probably to be used in both constraining the problem space and assessing candidate solutions. Examples of a forecast contribution are the Speed Forecast Contribution and the Straight leg forecast contribution.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="section" id="d5e5946"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">19.1.3.12.&nbsp;Measurement contribution</h4></div></div></div>
            

            <p>This type of contribution represents some measurement on the vehicle, such as that produced by a radar or sonar. The contribution is a time-stamped collection of measurements. Hard constraints may apply to error ranges on the sensor (bearing or range, for example). The measurement itself is interpreted as an estimate. An example of measurement contribution is the Bearing Measurement Contribution. The analyst should be provided with a means of suppressing some measurements. In the <span class="application">Debrief</span> implementation it is proposed that this is done by setting them to not visible in the Outline View.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="section" id="d5e5950"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">19.1.3.13.&nbsp;Analysis contribution</h4></div></div></div>
            

            <p>This type of contribution uses algorithms to either constrain the problem space, or assess the performance of a candidate solution - they contain no attributes. These contributions may not have to be explicitly specified by an analyst - they may be permanently present. An example of an analysis contribution is the Speed Analysis Contribution.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="d5e5953"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">19.1.4.&nbsp;Algorithms</h3></div></div></div>

            <p>It is thought that the generation and assessment of candidate solutions is an expensive process, so the problem space will be constrained as far as possible prior to consideration of candidate solutions. </p>

            <p>The analyst triggers the generation of a new solution, specifying a time period. Here's what happens next:</p>

                <p>Analyst-contributed measurement contributions are then applied to the bounded vehicle state. Measurement Contributions will typically generate a new bounded vehicle state for each measurement available.</p>

                <p>The system then repeatedly applies the analysis contributions, reference contributions, forecast contributions until the bounded vehicle state becomes stable. We repeatedly run through the contributions since some of them are capable of generating new bounded vehicle constraints - to which hard constraints present in forecast contributions and reference contributions should be applied. Any changes in contributions then need to be processed by the analysis contributions. </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.gif"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">

            <p>It is expected that the system will generate and investigate many, many solutions. For some scenarios there may be one (or few) solutions with very high performance. These can be presented directly to the analyst for consideration. For other scenarios there may be many solutions that offer a similar performance result. It is proposed that the system has a means by which it offers distinct solutions to the analyst, in order to further refine the contributions. Such processes could include:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Extreme solutions</span></dt><dd>
                    <p>The system could examine the solutions, and highlight those that have have extremes of course, speed, location within the bounded vehicle states. For these extreme solutions the system could show how particular contributions &#8216;contributed' to their performance score - to allow the estimate or hard constraints on those contributions to be relaxed/tightened.</p>

                    <p>Alternatively, where too many solutions are provided, the system could (somehow) provide a visualisation of the set of bounded vehicle states.

            <p>A measured contribution may be able to inspect its measurements in conjunction with the bounded vehicle states and determine that one of the legs is actually comprised of a combination of straight and alteration legs. For example, a measured frequency contribution may be able to recognise that a single leg is actually comprised of a straight leg, an alteration leg then another straight leg. Similarly, a contribution may be able to determine that an alteration leg actually contains a period of steady course and speed - and insert a straight leg covering that period. Note: if the leg has been created through an analyst's Straight leg forecast contribution specified as a hard-constraint then the leg will not be decomposed.</p>

              <p>As two vessels move past each other, the bearings typically follow a fairly smooth/regular curve. Below is a very poor representation, but it is possible to produce a mathematical smoothing of the bearing curve representing &#8220;sensor and subject in steady state&#8221;. When the bearings start to diverge from this curve then something has changed - either the sensor or subject have changed their course/speed vector. The only input necessary for this is the bearing data. But, it's of note that only the BearingMeasurementContribution knows the actual bearings, they're not visible outside. So, I believe the bearing-based MDA must sit &#8220;inside&#8221; the BearingMeasCont.</p>

              <p>Another way of detecting manoeuvres is by analysis of a series of bounded states. Where consecutive/adjacent states have incompatible bounds, we may be able to deduce that a manoeuvre must have happened. We may have a series of states with course bounds 040-080, then a series of states with a bounds 110-150. Clearly there must be a subject vehicle manoeuvre in between these states.</p>
