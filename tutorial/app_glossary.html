Debrief plots tracks in DR mode by plotting the positions as a series of course/speed legs from an origin.

In the initial release of the application the calculations use the Rhumb-Line Formulae, as described in 'Admiralty Manual of Navigation, Volume 2, 1973'. Short-distance sailing is defined as "the following of a rhumb-line track for a distance not greater than 600"</p></dd><dt id="g_etopo"><span class="glossterm">ETOPO</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>Standard for digital topographic data, predominantly distributed by the NOAA</p></dd><dt id="g_github"><span class="glossterm">GitHub</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p><a class="ulink" href="http://github.com" target="_top">GitHub.com</a> is a web-site providing a range of software development capabilities.

When written to a plot-file, each layer is stored separately - making it quite easy to copy individual layers out of a plot-file using a text-editor and collating them into a new file. (An example of this would be drawing exercise areas into one session, then moving them all into one layer, save the file to disk, copy this layer to a file of its own, then dropping this file of exercise areas into new files - an example of this is in the VPF best-practice, <a class="xref" href="configure_vpf.html#vpf_how_to" title="7.4.3.&nbsp;How to do it - 1">Section&nbsp;7.4.3, &#8220;How to do it - 1&#8221;</a>)</p></dd><dt id="g_lightweight"><span class="glossterm">Lightweight Tracks</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p> A simpler, faster version of a conventional track.

Typically these may represent the narrative recorded in a control room during an exercise, but alternatively they may contain a series of status messages retrieved from a sensor or weapon. All that is required is that the message have a DTG attached and that it may be represented in text form.</p></dd><dt id="g_ne"><span class="glossterm">Natural Earth</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>In 2015 support for Natural Earth data was added to Debrief. Natural Earth is a public domain, freely available dataset of Vector and Raster data.

Whilst Debrief stores course and speed data, and uses their values in calculations, they do not contribute to how the positions are plotted.

Double clicking on this plot forces the main plot to re-centre on the selected point, and dragging an area on this plot forces the main plot to zoom in on the selected area. The formatting on the overview chart is identical to (and unchangeable from) that on the main plot, with the exception that text is not plotted - to reduce clutter.</p></dd><dt id="g_perspective"><span class="glossterm">Perspective</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>Each Workbench window contains one or more perspectives. A perspective defines the initial set and layout of views in the Workbench window. Within the window, each perspective shares the same set of editors. Each perspective provides a set of functionality aimed at accomplishing a specific type of task or works with specific types of resources. For example, the <span class="guibutton">Tactical Analysis</span> perspective combines views that you would commonly use while editing analysing tactical files, while the <span class="guibutton">Contact Ork</span> perspective would help aliens (typically named Mork) in contacting their mother planet - together with the VOIP software link direct to Orson. As you work in the Workbench, you will probably switch perspectives frequently, especially if you're having Mindy trouble.</p><p>Perspectives control what appears in certain menus and toolbars. They define visible action sets, which you can change to customize a perspective. You can save a perspective that you build in this manner, making your own custom perspective that you can open again later.</p><p>You can use the <span class="guimenu">General &gt; Perspectives</span> preference page to open perspectives in the same window or in a new window.</p></dd><dt id="g_pfwtf"><span class="glossterm">PFWTF</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>Pacific Fleet Weapons Training Facility (see AFWTF).
