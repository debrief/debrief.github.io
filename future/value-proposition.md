## 🔹 Executive Summary  
Debrief is a powerful but ageing maritime analysis tool used across the Royal Navy, DSTL, and UK industry. While it continues to offer domain-relevant capabilities, its Java-based desktop architecture imposes increasing limitations on adoption, collaboration, maintainability, and integration.

This proposal sets out the strategic case for a browser-based replacement, aligning with MOD’s digital transformation ambitions while retaining the proven analytical power of Debrief. The rewrite will increase usability, support collaborative workflows, and enable integration with emerging MOD data infrastructures.

## 🔹 Why Modernisation is Urgent

### Operational & Technical Risks of Staying with Legacy Java:
- **Developer Risk:** Shrinking pool of Java desktop developers makes future support uncertain  
- **Integration Bottlenecks:** Hard to connect with modern web-based MOD tools or APIs  
- **Collaboration Limitations:** Single-user, file-based model prevents team-based analysis  
- **Installation Friction:** User-managed installs conflict with MOD security practices  
- **User Retention Risk:** Steep learning curve and hidden features lead to drop-off or manual workarounds

## 🔹 Strategic Alignment with MOD Priorities

| MOD Programme | Strategic Benefit of Debrief Rewrite |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Digital Backbone** | Seamless integration with wider Defence tools & networks |
| **Cloud-First Policy** | Supports MODCloud or hybrid deployment (browser + Electron) |
| **Open Standards** | REST/GraphQL APIs for loosely coupled, interoperable integration |
| **Cyber Resilience** | Secure identity (PKI/OIDC), reduced reliance on legacy Java |
| **MODL / DaaS / Maritime Digital Threads** | Enables track-level data to be queryable, reusable, and horizontally analysed |

---

## 🔹 Value to Core Users

| User Group | Benefits from Rewrite |
|------------|------------------------|
| **RN Analysts** | Easier deployment on MODNET; collaborative timelines; long-term data management |
| **DSTL Researchers** | Support for reproducible pipelines, centralised datasets, and access to code-wrapped algorithms |
| **UK Industry (e.g. sonar vendors)** | Data standardisation improves tech transfer and review processes |
| **NATO (potential user group)** | The NATO group familiar with Debrief previously found it too complex — a simplified, browser-based version could lower adoption barriers and support short-term analysts (e.g., 2-week exercise roles) |

---

## 🔹 New Capabilities the Rewrite Enables

1. **Real-Time Collaboration:** Analysts can co-analyse track data across MOD or coalition locations  
2. **MODNET Access:** No Java install; simple access via secure browser  
3. **Scenario-Specific UIs:** Lightweight modes for training or rapid tasking  
4. **Persistent, Shareable Data Store:** Central storage enables versioning, auditability, and non-spatial (horizontal) analysis  
5. **Modern Developer Ecosystem:** Easier onboarding, faster development, wider talent pool

## 🔹 Readiness and Opportunity

- A NATO-funded engagement begins within ~1 month, involving a “mini-Debrief” built with modern components  
- That work may seed the backend infrastructure and UI libraries for the full rewrite  
- Stakeholder interest already exists within **DSTL** and the **Operational Advantage Centre (RN)**  
- This is a low-risk, high-leverage moment to initiate funding exploration — with technical prototypes already in hand

## 🔹 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Identify sponsors** within DSTL, Navy Command, or Defence Digital  
2. **Use NATO prototype** as a showcase of future architecture  
3. **Scope initial roadmap** for modular rewrite (e.g., parsing, rendering, collaboration, server sync)  
4. **Seek funding** via capability sustainment, DSTL tasking, or multinational collaboration (e.g., NATO DIANA)
